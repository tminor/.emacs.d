* Emacs Configuration

I've been using Emacs somewhat consistently for about 2 months now.
Previously, I struggled with how to manage my =.emacs.d= suff, and
became easily overwhelmed once I'd added a few packages and any
configurations that went along with them.

I stumbled across several *good* =.emacs.d= examples and stole some
ideas and amalgamated them into something that worked for me. When I
use the term /work/, I mean that they are organized in a more coherent
way that allows me to make changes to them in a somewhat consistent way.

Maybe someday I'll understand how to work with dependencies and how
Emacs does its initialization magic, but for now it works well enough.
